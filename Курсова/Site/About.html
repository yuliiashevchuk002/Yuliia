<p>Be a team player</p>
<br>
<br>
<p1>Being able to work well in a team is vital. The better<br>
you can do it, the further you will go.You could have<br>
picked up the skills to do this in many different ways:<br>
the most obvious being as part of a sports team, club or society.
 <br>
 <br>
 Or you might have tackled a course-related project as part of<br>
 a groupo or fitted into a new team at work. Just as importantly,<br>
 you will need to think about the skills you brought to the team.
